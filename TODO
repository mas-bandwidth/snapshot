DONE

	Convert the bitpacker to C style

	Update the bitpacker tests to C style

	Convert the library to compile as C, not C++

TODO

	Extend to support reliable and unreliable messages.

	These will be data blocks, so serialization is outside the scope of this library (unlike yojimbo, which has bitpacked message types).

	This makes the library more flexible and portable across multiple languages.
