	---------------------------

	Incorporate reliable.io source code

	Update license to include netcode.io source code

	Integrate reliable so we have packet fragmentation and re-assembly, and sequence numbers and acks.

	---------------------------

	Verify tests pass on linux.

	Verify tests pass on windows.

	---------------------------	

	Now think what are the essential other things?

	A reliable-ordered channel with messages, bidirectional between client and server. For sure.

	The same command channel with in-line large blocks of data sent down (eg. snapshot baselines...)

	Unreliable messages stuck at the back of the packets (when there is room) for sound effects, visual fx etc...

	Choke.

	Server loop w. tick rate.

	Server sim objects step forward together.

	Player commands with input and dt sent redundantly all unacked.

	Schema

	What sort of properties are needed?

	Send uncompressed snapshots down.

	Send delta compressed snapshots down.
