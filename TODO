8520DONE

	Clean up the internal address stuff. I *really* don't think we need it.

	Setup a listen server example

	Something is up with the loopback client connect -- the server is accepting loopback into slot 0, then accepting the next client into slot 0 as well... what?

	Fixed. I just hadn't connected the loopback client on the server side.

	Bring back the console platform code

	Bring back ios.

	Get client server network simulator test working

	Apply network simulator to remainder of non-socket client server tests, this makes them more reliable across platforms so we don't have test failures due to timing or thread switching

TODO

	Fix up the crypto AEAD todos so they call into official snapshot_crypto_* functions.

	-------------

	Let's get zero copy working on write packet, including across simulator

	To do this, there should be a standard concept of a packet with a prefix in front, say 256 bytes.

	snapshot_create_packet

	snapshot_destroy_packet

	When spending packets to the simulator, it's OK to copy. This is a non-release codepath

	-------------

	Setup a semaphore job.

	Test on linux w. GCC and clang all versions matrix, warnings = errors.

	-------------

	Test on windows

	-------------

	Test on consoles

	Probably need to bring across and modify the testbed projects from next SDK...

	-------------

























	---------------------------

	Incorporate reliable.io source code

	Update license to include reliable.io source code

	Integrate reliable so we have packet fragmentation and re-assembly, and sequence numbers and acks.

	---------------------------	

	Now think what are the essential other things?

	A reliable-ordered channel with messages, bidirectional between client and server. For sure.

	The same command channel with in-line large blocks of data sent down (eg. snapshot baselines...)

	Unreliable messages stuck at the back of the packets (when there is room) for sound effects, visual fx etc...

	Player commands with input and dt sent redundantly all unacked.

	Choke.

	Server loop w. tick rate.

	Server sim objects step forward together.

	Player owned objects advanced forward with player command dt as they arrive.

	Schema

	What sort of properties are needed?

	Send uncompressed snapshots down.

	Send delta compressed snapshots down.
