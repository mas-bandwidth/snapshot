TODO

	Setup a snapshot UE4 plugin

	Verify client and server can connect and operate in testbed.

	-------------

	Now think what are the essential other things?

	A reliable-ordered channel with messages, bidirectional between client and server. For sure.

	The same command channel with in-line large blocks of data sent down (eg. snapshot baselines...)

	Unreliable messages stuck at the back of the packets (when there is room) for sound effects, visual fx etc...

	Player commands with input and dt sent redundantly all unacked.

	Choke.

	Server loop w. tick rate.

	Server sim objects step forward together.

	Player owned objects advanced forward with player command dt as they arrive.

	Schema

	What sort of properties are needed?

	Send uncompressed snapshots down.

	Send delta compressed snapshots down.
