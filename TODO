DONE

	Import basic platform files

	Get compiling with premake and stub test.cpp

	Prefix all files with snapshot_

	Setup snapshot.h with definitions needed by all files (eg. platform detection, endianness, asserts etc...)

	Get snapshot_crypto.h/cpp compiling

	Get snapshot_address.h in

	Setup snapshot_platform.h so there is one header interface for platform functions

	Implement snapshot.cpp so we can init and term the library

	Setup snapshot_address.cpp

	Hack up snapshot_assert

	Hack up snapshot_printf

	Hack up snapshot_malloc/free

	Get mac platform cpp fully compiling and linking

	Clean up pass to make sure what's there doesn't suck

	Fix up linux platform

	Drop the other platforms for now. They can be brought back later easily.

	Fix windows platform

TODO

	Bring across some basic platform tests

		0. time
		1. address
		2. sockets
		3. threads
		4. mutex

	---------------------------

	Verify tests pass on mac.

	---------------------------

	Bring across bitpacker and serialize from yojimbo

	Update license to include yojimbo license

	Bring across bitpacker and serialize tests

	---------------------------

	Incorporate netcode.io source code

	Update license to include netcode.io source code

	---------------------------

	Incorporate reliable.io source code

	Update license to include netcode.io source code

	---------------------------

	Verify tests pass on linux.

	Verify tests pass on windows.

	---------------------------	

	Get to the point where we have a working snapshot_client and snapshot_server using netcode

	Now think what are the essential other things?

	A command channel with messages, bidirectional between client and server. For sure.

	Packet fragmentation and re-assembly...

	Reliability header and acks.

	Unreliable messages stuck at the back of the packets (when there is room).

	Choke.

	Server loop w. tick rate.

	Server sim objects.

	Player frames sim w. inputs dt.

	Schema

	What sort of properties are needed?

	Send uncompressed snapshots down.
