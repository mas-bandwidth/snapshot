DONE

	Extend client counters to cover common situations

	Extend server counters to cover common situations

	Soak test

	Extend soak test to do the thing with random payloads

	Setup malloc/free overrides and check for memory leaks in soak test.

	Implement printf override function, and use it in soak test.

	Fix bug in memory alloc/free prints (print after itor destroyed).

	Implement assert override function, and use it in soak test.

TODO

	Update to latest PS4/PS5 tooling

	-------------

	Verify unit tests run on PS5.

	-------------

	Verify PS5 client connects to linux server.

	-------------

	Download UE5.

	Setup a snapshot UE5 plugin based on the network next UE4 plugin.

	Verify client and server can connect and operate in testbed.

	-------------

	Verify PS5 client can connect to PC server in UE5.

	-------------

	*** FIRST MILESTONE: SnapshotNetDriver in UE5, working on PC and PS5 ***

	-------------

























	--------------

	Update to latest XBox Series X and GDK tooling

	Get series x testbed working

	-------------

	Setup additional PCs as build farm for sem

	-------------

	Now think what are the essential other things?

	A reliable-ordered channel with messages, bidirectional between client and server. For sure.

	The same command channel with in-line large blocks of data sent down (eg. snapshot baselines...)

	Unreliable messages stuck at the back of the packets (when there is room) for sound effects, visual fx etc...

	Player commands with input and dt sent redundantly all unacked.

	Choke.

	*** SECOND MILESTONE: Low-level protocol is complete ***

	---------------------------

	Schema

	What sort of properties are needed?

	Send delta compressed snapshots down.

	Decompress snapshot deltas on client.

	Drive object creates and deletes.

	---------------------------

	Slothy input:

		1. Uncompressed snapshots probably won't work, players are remote working not LAN

		2. Concerns around disruptive integration, how exactly does it integrate?

		3. How do we tell when object properties have changed? <----- call function when changed?

		4. Separation of client/server instances of engine objects seems like a heavy lift

		5. How do UE5 objects work?
