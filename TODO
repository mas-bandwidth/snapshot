DONE

	Import basic platform files

	Get compiling with premake and stub test.cpp

	Prefix all files with snapshot_

	Setup snapshot.h with definitions needed by all files (eg. platform detection, endianness, asserts etc...)

	Get snapshot_crypto.h/cpp compiling

TODO

	Get snapshot_address.h / cpp in

	Get mac platform cut down and compiling

	Setup snapshot_platform.h and snapshot_platform.cpp so there is an interface to platform stuff that multiple files can call

	Implement snapshot.cpp so we can init and term the library
